Scyfe is an overlay, peer-to-peer network with multicast elements that replaces the trusted-server
in traditional client-server architecture with a plurality voting scheme. 

Each folder in this directory contains a different module. Each module should be mostly
self-dependant, but this may not be true (and is certainly not true in the case of the Client and Server
objects.) See the same-named code file in each directory to see details about the module. 

To run the module, execute Client, Server, or Tests.

Best to start out at Client.
