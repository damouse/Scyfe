Scyfe is an overlay, peer-to-peer network with multicast elements that replaces the trusted-server
in traditional client-server architecture with a plurality voting scheme. 

Each folder in this directory contains a different module. Each module should be mostly
self-dependant, but this may not be true (and is certainly not true in the case of the Client and Server
objects.) See the same-named code file in each directory to see details about the module. 

All functionality is executed from the Scyfe.py top level script. It should take a runtype and an IP
address (most likely for the server) and run from there. 

All imports are relative to the project root (this directory.)

Do not use print(). Use Utils.log(). The first argument is the name of the class logging, the second
is the contents of the log message. It will make things a lot easier later.
